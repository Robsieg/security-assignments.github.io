# Polyalphabetic substitution and Transposition Ciphers

1.  Using polyalphabetic substitution, with alphabet a–z (no caps), spaces translated to an underscore character (`_`), and a period (`.`, as the last character of the alphabet), use the private key `security` to encrypt the plaintext message:

         send_money

    To help you, use the following formula:

        Encryption: ciphertext = (plaintext + key) mod 28

        Decryption: plaintext = (ciphertext - key) mod 28

    Number your alphabet so that it starts with zero, e.g., `A = 0, Z=25, _ = 26, . = 27`.
    This means that your alphabet will be `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz_.`

    As a general rule for shift ciphers, *the modulus is always the size of the alphabet, but you must start your alphabet at 0*.

    To check your understanding of modular arithmetic, review [these examples on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_arithmetic#Examples).

    You may use [an online vignere cipher calculator](https://cryptii.com/pipes/vigenere-cipher) to check your work. If you use
    this calculator, remember to customize the default alphabet to include periods and underscores.

    {% include lab_question.html question='What is the ciphertext when encrypting "send_money" with the key "security" and alphabet <code>abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz_.</code>?' %}


2.	Consider the transposition method discussed in class.  Assume the plaintext is

        attack postponed until two am

    and the key is `security`

    Create the ciphertext using columnar transposition (demonstrated in class). Remove spaces from the plaintext.

    You may use [an online columnar transposition calculator](https://crypto.interactive-maths.com/columnar-transposition-cipher.html) to check your work.

<div class='alert alert-danger'><strong>Heads up!</strong> After completing this section, you should understand frequency analysis to the point that you are able to perform frequency analysis by hand on a short ciphertext.</div>

**Questions:**

1.  What are the four most frequent characters, in descending order?
    Examine the frequency table chart at [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_analysis).
    What does this suggest the four letters identified correspond to?

    {% include lab_question.html question='What are the four most frequent characters?' %}

2.  Analyze bigrams and trigrams in the ciphertext.

    What do the most frequent ciphertext bigrams suggest the three 2-length N-grams identified correspond to in English plaintext?

    Also examine N-grams of length 3, and report the likely plaintext identities of the four 3-length N-grams reported. (Use [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigram](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigram)).

    {% include lab_question.html question='What are the three most frequent trigrams?' %}

3.  Assume that a simple cipher that shifts all characters by a fixed number was used to create the cipertext (a caesar cipher). Given the results of the frequency analysis, what would the shift key have been (the shift to go from plaintext to ciphertext)?
    Don’t be proud; you can use your fingers to count.

    {% include lab_question.html question='What is the key of the ciphertext, counting forwards?' %}

4.  What is the plaintext?

    **Hint:** You can use an online caesar cipher encoder/decoder such as [this one](https://cryptii.com/pipes/caesar-cipher)
    to test your key,
    although you should be able to perform frequency analysis by hand on short texts.

    {% include lab_question.html question='What author is quoted in the plaintext?' %}



# One-time Pad

Decrypt the following ciphertext using the following one-time pads, using an XOR bitwise operation.

You may use an online tool such as [cryptii.com](https://cryptii.com). For example, select "bitwise operation":

{% include lab-image.html image='cryptii-bitwise-select.png' %}

And then choose "XOR", leaving the operation on "encode":

{% include lab-image.html image='cryptii-otp.png' %}

<div class='alert alert-warning'><strong>Heads up!</strong> When using cryptii for this XOR,
leave it on <i>encode</i>, <strong>not</strong> <i>decode</i>. This is because to undo
XOR for decryption, the same operation is done as to do it in the encryption. Again,
leave it on <i>encode</i> for XOR even though you are decrypting.</div>

Ciphertext (hexadecimal): `E0 C5 B5 B0 82 9A 8A DA B8 FD 8A 9E 67 5A 57`

1. One-time pad 1: `A1 B1 C1 D1 E1 F1 AA BB CC DD EE FF 10 34 76`

    {% include lab_question.html question='What is the plaintext using the one-time pad 1?' %}

2. One-time pad 2: `B2 A0 C1 C2 E7 FB FE FA D9 89 AA AF 56 6A 67`

    {% include lab_question.html question='What is the plaintext using the one-time pad 2?' %}

3. One-time pad 3: `B3 B0 C7 C2 E7 F4 EE BF CA DD EC F1 15 2E 76`

    {% include lab_question.html question='What is the plaintext using the one-time pad 3?' %}

4. One-time pad 4: `B4 AD D0 90 E1 FB FE FA D1 8E AA FA 02 3B 33`

    {% include lab_question.html question='What is the plaintext using the one-time pad 4?' %}

{% include lab_question.html question='How many possible plaintexts exist for this one-time-pad ciphertext?' %}


# Hashing

Hash the following [plaintext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zimmermann_Telegram) using multiple hashing algorithms.

    We intend to begin on the first of February unrestricted submarine warfare.
    We shall endeavor in spite of this to keep the United States of America neutral.
    In the event of this not succeeding, we make Mexico a proposal of alliance on
    the following basis: make war together, make peace together, generous financial
    support and an understanding on our part that Mexico is to reconquer the lost
    territory in Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona. The settlement in detail is left to
    you. You will inform the President of the above most secretly as soon as the
    outbreak of war with the United States of America is certain, and add the
    suggestion that he should, on his own initiative, invite Japan to immediate
    adherence and at the same time mediate between Japan and ourselves. Please call
    the President's attention to the fact that the ruthless employment of our
    submarines now offers the prospect of compelling England in a few months to
    make peace.

    Signed, ZIMMERMANN

You may use a tool such as [cryptii.com](https://cryptii.com). For example,
select "Hash function" from towards the bottom of the menu:

{% include lab-image.html image='cryptii-hash-select.png' %}

And use it as follows:

{% include lab-image.html image='cryptii-hashing-text.png' %}



**Questions:**

1.	What is the length of each of the following algorithm hashes in bytes? MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-512? How many bits does each hash represent?

    (hint: how many bits are in one hex digit -- also called a 'nibble'? How many nibbles in the key? Or, How many bits in a byte, and how many bytes in a two-digit hex number like 'FA'? Review [this](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal_numeral_system) if you're still stuck)

    {% include lab_question.html question='How many bits are in an MD5 hash?' %}

Change just a single bit in content that you are hashing. e.g, change an “A” — 1010 to a B — 1011. Examine the hashes of the modified content.
Since you only changed a single bit in a file of billions of bits, you might reason that the hashes would be nearly the same. Are they?

In cryptii, you can switch to a hex view thusly in order to make your single-bit-edit easier:

{% include lab-image.html image='cryptii-hashing-hex.png' %}

{% include lab_question.html question='Assume a 10 GB file is hashed. If only one bit is changed on a 10 GB file and then it is hashed again, how will the second hash compare to the first?' %}
{% include lab_question.html question='Which property of cryptographic hash functions is most related to the previous question?' %}




# Symmetric encryption with AES

Decrypt the message below using AES and the following parameters:
Message (base64):

- Algorithm: AES-256
- Chaining mode: CBC
- IV (hexadecimal): `15 7F 14 FF DF D1 D4 25 D9 CB BD 12 ED 98 49 2F`
- Key (hexadecimal): `FA 71 7D 51 3F D7 32 7D D9 C7 13 84 43 47 C2 5B 2F 9C 1E 48 67 C6 81 32 85 5A 13 92 60 A8 79 44`

You can do this on cryptii using the "Block Cipher" tool. To do so:

1.  Start by selecting the "Encoding > Base64" tool.

    {% include lab-image.html image='cryptii-base64.png' %}
1.  Set the base64 to "decode" mode.
1.  Paste the above base64-encoded string into the leftmost "text" node.
    Make sure there are no extra characters after the final `=` in the pasted
    value (not even a return character!).

    The output of the base64 tool will be bytes.

    {% include lab-image.html image='cryptii-base64-decode.png' %}

1.  Add a "Modern Cryptography > Block Cipher" tool to the flow, so that the bytes flow
    into it. Set the block cipher tool to use AES-256, and use the algorithm settings noted above.

    {% include lab-image.html image='cryptii-aes-add-block.png' %}
    {% include lab-image.html image='cryptii-aes.png' %}

What is the plaintext of the message?

{% include lab_question.html question='What is the URL included in the plaintext you decrypted with AES?' %}


# Message Sharing

Use AES or another symmetric block cipher to encrypt/decrypt messages exchanged between you and another class member. You can use a site such as [cryptii.com](https://cryptii.com).

You and your classmate should agree on a password for encrypting the message. You can generate a key and an IV from a password using the `openssl` tool, available from your Kali instance. For example, if you had agreed on the password `Password1`,
you could run the following to get the corresponding key and IV:

    openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -P -pass pass:Password1 -nosalt

Running the above will give the same output every time. It would lead to the following output:

{% include lab-image.html image='openssl-generate-key-and-iv.png' %}

Where:

*   `enc` tells `openssl` to use its symmetric cipher routines
*   the block cipher is `aes cbc` with a block size of 256
*   the password from which the key and IV are derived is `Password1`
    *   (in real life, please never use a password this weak!)
*   `-nosalt` tells `openssl` to not introduce randomness into the process of generating a key and IV from a password (in practice, you should let it use a salt -- more on this in a future lab)
*   `-P` tells `openssl` to:

        -P  print out the key and IV used then immediately exit: don't do any encryption or decryption.

    (see `man enc`)

You and your classmate should agree on a password, then use that password to share a message using AES.


Questions:

* {% include lab_question.html question='How did you ensure that your key exchange was safe? How would you exchange keys if you were not in the same location?' %}
* {% include lab_question.html question='Which of the parameters of a block cipher (e.g., algorithm name, mode of operation, IV (if any), key length) are <strong>essential</strong> to keep secret? Security through obscurity does not count as "essential".' %}
